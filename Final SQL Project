#Chinook SQL Analysis Project

#Overview

#This project showcases my ability to analyze business data using SQL within the Chinook database, a dataset 
designed to mimic a digital media store. The queries included demonstrate proficiency in data extraction, 
aggregation, joins, filtering, and performance optimization using SQLite.

#Key analyses in this project include:
	•	Identifying top-performing sales agents based on total revenue.
	•	Analyzing sales trends by year to uncover key business insights.
	•	Utilizing JOIN operations (INNER and LEFT JOINs) to connect relevant datasets.
	•	Implementing grouping and ordering techniques to structure meaningful reports.

#These queries highlight my expertise in SQL for business analytics and my ability to transform raw data into 
actionable insights.
