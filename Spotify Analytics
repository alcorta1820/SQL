# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined what the top 5 popular songs were.

select artist_name, track_name, popularity, danceability,duration_ms
from bit_db.spotifydata
order by popularity DESC
limit 5;


#Then I determined what song out of the top 5 most popular has the highest danceability.

select artist_name, track_name, popularity, danceability
from bit_db.spotifydata
order by popularity DESC, danceability DESC
limit 1;


#Then - Out of the top 5 most popular songs what artist has the longest song?

select artist_name, track_name, popularity, max(duration_ms)
from bit_db.spotifydata
where track_name
in (select track_name
from bit_db.spotifydata
order by popularity DESC
limit 5);

#Then - What is the avg danceability for the top 5 most popular songs?

select avg(danceability)
from bit_db.spotifydata
where track_name
in (select track_name
from bit_db.spotifydata
order by popularity DESC
limit 5);


#Then -What songs are the 5 least popular songs?

select artist_name, track_name, popularity, danceability
from bit_db.spotifydata
order by popularity ASC
limit 5;



#Then -What is the danceability for the least popular song?

select artist_name, track_name, popularity, danceability
from bit_db.spotifydata
where track_name
in (select track_name
from bit_db.spotifydata
order by popularity ASC
limit 1);


#Then -What are the top 5 least danceable songs?

select artist_name, track_name, danceability, popularity
from bit_db.spotifydata
order by danceability ASC
limit 5;

#Then -What is the popularity for the least danceable song?

select popularity
from bit_db.spotifydata
order by danceability ASC
limit 1;
