#This project utilizes the following Superstore data: 

CREATE TABLE superstore (
    item_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    item_name TEXT,
    category TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    stock_quantity INTEGER,
    average_rating DECIMAL(3, 2)
);

INSERT INTO superstore (item_id, item_name, category, price, stock_quantity, average_rating)
VALUES
    (1, 'Stainless Steel Cookware Set', 'Kitchen Supplies', 89.99, 50, 4.6),
    (2, 'Memory Foam Mattress', 'Furnishings', 499.99, 30, 4.8),
    (3, 'Smart LED TV', 'Electronics', 549.00, 20, 4.5),
    (4, 'Robot Vacuum Cleaner', 'Appliances', 199.50, 40, 4.3),
    (5, 'Wireless Bluetooth Speaker', 'Electronics', 39.99, 60, 4.2),
    (6, 'Non-Stick Baking Set', 'Kitchen Supplies', 29.95, 80, 4.4),
    (7, 'Cotton Bedding Set', 'Furnishings', 89.00, 25, 4.7),
    (8, 'Smart Home Security Camera', 'Electronics', 79.95, 15, 4.1),

#For this project, I used SQL to query the Superstore database to get information about items sold at the store and their prices. 


--Write a SQL query that orders the items by price.

SELECT price
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price;


--Write your own SQL query that will show a statistic about the item prices, like a sum, average, minimum, maximum, or count.

SELECT AVG(average_rating),category
FROM superstore
GROUP BY category;

--Write your own SQL query that will show a statistic about the price for items in the category of "Kitchen Supplies". NOTE: The values in the categories column are called text strings, and text strings are case sensitive. That means if you want to select "Kitchen Supplies", you will need to type it exactly as it appears in the data, i.e., with a capital "K" and a capital "S".

SELECT MAX(stock_quantity), category, item_name
FROM superstore
WHERE category = "Kitchen Supplies"
GROUP BY item_name
ORDER BY MAX(stock_quantity) DESC;

--Come up with your own question about the data and try to answer it using SQL. For example: How many air purifiers are in stock? It's okay if you can't figure out how to answer your question, the idea here is to practice thinking about what kinds of insights you can get from a dataset from asking questions about it.

--What is the avg rating for the most stocked item?

SELECT average_rating, item_name, stock_quantity
FROM superstore
GROUP BY item_name, average_rating, stock_quantity
ORDER BY MAX(stock_quantity) DESC;
